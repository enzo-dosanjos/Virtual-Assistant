# Virtual-Assistant
Small project made when I was a kid because, as every kid who watched Iron man, I wanted my own Jarvis, my own virtual assistant.

This is a virtual assistant called Aina to which you can ask a lot of things such as the weather, make a morning routine, put an alarm, make a google research or even control your computer
